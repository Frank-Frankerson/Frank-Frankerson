## Yo. I'm Jess üëã

_Pronouns: She / Her, but mostly Any will do._

**Question:** Why is your username Frank?

**Answer:** It's a nickname and I like it. People also call me Bear. Formally I'm Jessica, but it's all the same person.

### Currently Working On

I'm currently a Senior Developer, CX. I work heavily on the technical aspect of sending out communications which includes building personalized emails at scale, understanding and querying data, managing the Oracle Responsys platform, and more.

### Currently Learning

While I'm not working I am currently taking a Full Stack Developer course to expand my programming skills. I want to move beyond the programming knowledge I work with inside our communication platforms and understand more of the code that our Software Engineers use to build APIs.

Beyond that I'm trying to grasp deeper understanding of AI and how to implement it into my work to make myself and my team more efficient.

### Fun Fact üêª

Bears have an excellent sense of smell that allows them to detect food from miles away. It is said to be seven times better than that of a bloodhound's smell.
